In PHP, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with array keys that are not explicitly defined. If you attempt to access an array element using a key that doesn't exist, PHP won't throw an error but instead silently return `null`. This can lead to unexpected behavior and difficult-to-debug issues.  For example:
```php
$myArray = ['a' => 1, 'b' => 2];
$value = $myArray['c']; // $value will be null, no error is thrown
```
This can be particularly problematic when performing calculations or comparisons based on the values retrieved from the array.  The unexpected `null` can lead to incorrect results without any obvious warnings.
