To avoid this silent failure and make your code more robust, always check if an array key exists before accessing it.  Use the `isset()` function to verify the key's existence:
```php
$myArray = ['a' => 1, 'b' => 2];

if (isset($myArray['c'])) {
  $value = $myArray['c'];
  // Perform operations with $value
} else {
  // Handle the case where the key doesn't exist
  $value = 0; // Or another default value
}
```
Alternatively, the null coalescing operator (`??`) can provide a more concise way to handle this:
```php
$myArray = ['a' => 1, 'b' => 2];
$value = $myArray['c'] ?? 0; // $value will be 0 if 'c' is not set
```
By incorporating these checks into your code, you prevent unexpected behavior caused by accessing undefined array keys.
